Rebase might be outlawed in your project. There may be local, cultural objections. Some projects or organizations consider rebase as a form of heresy, and an act of desecration. Some people believe the Git history should be an inviolable, permanent record of what has happened. So, rebase might be off the table.

But, used locally, on private branches, rebase is a useful tool.

Push after you’ve rebased, and restrict it to branches where you’re the only developer. Or at least, where all development has stopped, and no one else has based any other work off your branch’s commits.

Do that and you’ll avoid any issues.
